Bugs since 15:

Other bugs:

  What happens at state = 12 if you delete the map, and all the keys?
  On game load, helmet shouldn't say "approaching X", it should say "Docked at X"
  Should journey reset at launch, or persist as part of game state?

-------

Foresight:

  Verify that shield port label is working properly on game load
    missions.js -> verreciel.shield.port.event = verreciel.items.shield;

-------

Compare side by side with Swift build
  game state: 15
  iOS game state: 15

Find a better method to draw lines
Run a JavaScript linter

-------

LOOK OUT: Never override a method with a different signature

Render every location panel
  Does it look good?

Console updates
  When selecting locations on the map, the radar should update the console if it's connected to the console
  Cargo doesn't update console when an item is removed from the hold
  etc.  

Rethink missions
  They should be accumulative, at least in part
  Keep Cargo connected to Console, why doncha

Walkthroughs, too
State recovery
  What are some states that cannot be returned to?

What should be interactive, when?

Maybe systems could slowly orbit their stars, and stars could orbit the center

Spacewalk
  Out the hatch, presumably
