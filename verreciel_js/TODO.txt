TODO

Detect, fix attempts at polymorphism
  Methods being called with different combinations of parameters, for instance
    Create utility method that counts args

Create a replacement for SCNTransaction
  This one's a toughie
  Keep track of what gets animated this way
  If it's just a subset of things, then only a subset solution is required
  // TODO: SCNTransaction

ThreeJS stuff in components
  // TODO: THREEJS

Capsule::dock and Capsule.dock
  The method is "dock"
  The property is now "location"
  Do a correction pass

Is Location::isKnown in the game state?
  Does it need to be?
  Who calls Capsule::closestKnownLocation?

Renamed map to nav and Map to Nav
Rename mapPort to navPort
  Do a correction pass

Renamed Empty::color to Empty::applyColor
  Do a correction pass
  This is the weird one, too

ScenePortSlot::enable/disable with text and color became enableAndShow/disableAndShow

Different constructors expect different values, jesus
